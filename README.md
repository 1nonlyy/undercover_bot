Here is the telegram bot for playing "Undercover" word-based group social deduction game. I builded this bot as a better analogue of mobile app version of this game, because mobile application was heavy, unconvenient and need some alters to better user experience.
You can find the bot like this: https://t.me/undercover0_bot
Here are two ways of playing the game by using this bot:
1. You can add the bot to the group chat (GC) where by furhter instructions you can play with friends.
2. This is the second way of using this bot. If among the friends only one of you have access to the bot, you can directly organize the game in the chat of this bot, where will be all management during the game.
